                    <h3> Hello from Vivek</h3>
                   <p> I am from Shimoga , Karnataka
                    I completed my bachelor’s in civil engineering in 2018 at Jawaharlal 
                    Nehru national college of engineering, Shimoga, during my time in college
                     I was a proactive member of organizing college and department fests.
                      after college started working as a freelancer in Shimoga as an interior 
                      designer and 3D visualizer, and later joined NOLTE INDIA as 3D Visualizer,
                       while I was working, I and my friend came up with a startup idea in the
                        field of   Architectural visualization(voxel), we need to shut it down because we didn’t get the investors and we didn’t had the money to bootstrap.  while I was in the startup process, I learned two things about myself.  firstly, I enjoy the process of creating things, and secondly am a very quick learner of new technologies, I self-taught unreal engine within 6 months for the start-up, and it was hard for me to pack up the startup.
                   </p> 
                   After that i started learning front-end web technologies ,  and created 
                    these projects within 4 months. Looking forward to having a wonderful 
                    career in an esteemed company that inspires and motivates me I want 
                    to become the GO-TO person for web technologies.
